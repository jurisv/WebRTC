# A simple demonstration of WebRTC powered by OpenTok and the Sencha Ext6 Framework. 
## Getting Started
So you want to do peer-to-peer audio and video calls. Well there's a lot of behind the scenes 
optimizations that are taken care of by using the OpenTok services. 

You also want an extensible web framework that ties into your enterprise strategy. This is where ExtJs 6 excels. 

Finally you would like something that handles data in real-time in both directions.. Make a change locally and your change is replicated to all connecte clients. New data changes are pushed directly to your client without reloading the page or even performing AJAX polling.

There is both a development and production build of the WebRTC application. 
In addition there is a node.js server that will serve up either a development or production version of the app. 
The directory is controlled by an environment variable.
## Step 1. Get your OpenTok Api Key
